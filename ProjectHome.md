# The openIP project #
The openIP is an open source project of the Image Processing Group of Debrecen, University of Debrecen, to create a c++ library providing the most common methods and algorithms in the field of image processing and computer vision.

If You are interested in the library as a user or developer, feel free to access me at gyuriofkovacs@gmail.com.

We are looking for developers!

<h1>Feature List</h1>

The coarse list of features, without the demand of completeness:<br>
<ul><li>openipDS library (basic data-structures)<br>
</li><li>openipIO library (image and video input/output)<br>
</li><li>openipSC library (wrapper over GSL for numerical methods)<br>
</li><li>openipLL library (low level image processing methods)<br>
</li><li>openipML library (machine learning algorithms)<br>
</li><li>openipVS library (visualization tools)</li></ul>

<h1>Technical Details</h1>
